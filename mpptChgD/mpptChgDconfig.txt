# mpptChgD configuration file
#
# Configure the following optional functions:
#   1. Auto shutdown enable
#   2. TCP Access
#   3. Charger register value Logging
#   4. Charger configuration parameters
#   5. Watchdog enable
#
# All options shown below. Uncomment to enable. Configuration items have the form
# <ITEM>=<VALUE> where <VALUE> may be an integer or string value.  Items that are
# used to enable functionality (such as SHUTDOWN below) may either be commented out
# or set to 0 to disable.  Uncomment them and set the value to 1 to enable.
#
# Comments are indicated by a '#' or ';' character in the first position.
#

# Automatic Low Battery shutdown.  Uncomment the following line to enable a controlled
# OS shutdown upon detection of an imminent power down due to low battery.
SHUTDOWN=1

# Remote TCP access.  Uncomment and set the TCP_PORT to a non-zero number to enable
# TCP access to the daemon.
TCP_PORT=23000
# Maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections (default is 1 connection, maximum 4)
TCP_MAX=4

# Logging parameters
#
# Configure the logfile
LOG_FILE=/home/pi/mpptChgDlog.txt
#
# Number of seconds between log entries
LOG_DELAY=60
#
# Log items.  Uncomment charger register values you wish to log.  Important to note that items
# are logged in the following order, even if the actual enable lines in this file are re-ordered.
# Items that are not enabled are skipped.  See the user manual for an explanation of each register.  No log file is generated if all LOG items are commented out.
# Values are logged as base-10 decimal numbers separated by a space character.
#   ID, STATUS, BUCK, VS, IS, VB, IB, IC, IT, ET, VM, TH, BULKV, FLOATV, PWROFFV, PWRONV, WDEN, WDCNT

# Charger parameters.  Uncomment the following lines to configure non-default charger configuration
# parameters.
#
# Battery BULK/ABSORPTION charge voltage threshold for 25C in mV - must be within 14000 - 15000 mV (BULKV)
#BULKV=14700
#
# Battery FLOAT charge voltage threshold for 25C in mV - must be within 13000 - 14000 mV (FLOATV)
#FLOATV=13650
#
# Low Battery power-off threshold in mV - must be within 11000 - 12000 mV (PWROFF)
#PWROFFV=11500
#
# Battery power-on restart threshold in mV - must be within 12000 - 13000 mV (PWRONV)
#PWRONV=12500

# Watchdog Enable.  Uncomment the following line to enable the daemon to control the charger's
# watchdog mechanism.  It will enable the watchdog functionality and make sure that it is
# updated in order to not cycle power.  The daemon will catch most terminal signals and
# automatically disable the watchdog before exiting.  However a hard kill of the daemon will
# leave the watchdog running and unless it is disabled via another facility, the charger will
# power cycle the system within 120 - 180 seconds.
#
# Note that the existing WDPWROFF register value is used for the power-cycle time for board
# firmware versions 1.2 forward.  By default this value is 10 seconds.
#WATCHDOG=1
